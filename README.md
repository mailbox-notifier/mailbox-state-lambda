The Lambda function, named `mailbox-state-lambda`, is an integral part of a smart mailbox system
designed to monitor and respond to the state changes of a physical mailbox. It is deployed within the AWS ecosystem,
leveraging various AWS services for efficient and scalable operation.

**Trigger Mechanism:**

- The Lambda is primarily triggered by HTTP requests made to an AWS API Gateway. This setup allows it to respond to
  external events indicating the mailbox's door state, typically "open" and "closed" events.
- The API Gateway is configured with two main routes: `/open` and `/closed`, which correspond to the two primary states
  of the mailbox. These routes are linked to the Lambda function, invoking it with the respective state information.

**Functionality and Internal Logic:**

- Upon invocation, the Lambda function first parses the incoming event to determine the mailbox state change,
  identifying whether the mailbox was opened or closed.
- The core logic of the Lambda function is to update the state of the mailbox in a database and manage notifications
  based on state transitions.

**State Management:**

- The Lambda function interacts with an AWS DynamoDB table to record and track the state of the mailbox. The table
  stores a counter representing the number of times the mailbox has been opened.
- When the mailbox is opened (`/open` route), the function increments this counter. When it's closed (`/closed` route),
  the counter is reset to zero.

**Notifications and Messaging:**

- The function uses AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send notifications or alerts based on specific conditions.
- Upon opening the mailbox (first "open" event), it sends a notification indicating that the mailbox is open.
- If the mailbox remains open and additional "open" events are received, indicating that the mailbox is ajar, it
  implements an exponential backoff strategy for sending further notifications. This approach involves sending
  notifications less frequently over time to prevent alert fatigue. The decision to send these follow-up notifications
  is based on the counter value from DynamoDB.

**Exponential Backoff Logic:**

- The Lambda function calculates whether to send a follow-up notification based on the counter value, adhering to an
  exponential backoff algorithm.
- The notifications are sent when the counter value reaches powers of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, ...). This calculation is
  done each time the function is invoked with an "open" event, using the updated counter value from DynamoDB.

**Error Handling and Logging:**

- The function includes error handling to manage potential issues during execution, such as failures in database
  interaction or notification sending.
- It logs important events and errors to AWS CloudWatch, facilitating monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Security and Permissions:**

- Appropriate IAM roles and policies are attached to the Lambda function, granting it the necessary permissions to
  interact with DynamoDB and SNS.

**Conclusion:**

The `mailbox-door-state-notification-lambda` Lambda function acts as a smart intermediary between a physical mailbox and
the digital world. It effectively records mailbox state changes, manages state persistence in DynamoDB, and communicates
with users through SNS notifications, all while optimizing alert frequency using exponential backoff logic.
